        <p>Use your web inspector to hack your way through a series of challenges.</p>

        <p>The web inspector is a hidden panel available in all web browsers that allows you to navigate through elements on a page and temporarily change them.</p>

        <p>In Google Chrome, you can open your web inspector by right clicking in the browser window and clicking the last option, <strong>"Inspect"</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Useful Inspector Tabs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Once open, you will immediately see the HTML for the page you're looking at. This is the <strong>"Elements"</strong> tab. Use this area to expand, collapse, and temporarily edit the HTML sections to have a look around.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Under <strong>"Elements"</strong>, on the right side, you will see a <em>Styles</em> panel. Use this area to see and temporarily edit the CSS styles on the page.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The next tab over is the <strong>"Console"</strong> tab. This shows the logs and errors of the JavaScript that's being rendered on the page. You will see validation, tips, and hints here.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><strong>"Sources"</strong> is the next tab over. It'll tell you what files are being loaded into the browser for that page. Here you should see our HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If you skip over a few tabs, the last tab we will be using is the <strong>"Application"</strong> tab. Here we will be working with the <strong>"Local Storage"</strong> area, which shows any data that our website has saved to your browser.</p>
